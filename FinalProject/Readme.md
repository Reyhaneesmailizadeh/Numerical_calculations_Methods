# Introduction
As also mentioned in Wikipedia, the n-body simulation problem can have different dimensions. What is simulated here is the movement of three particles in space using the Runge-Kutta method. First, the positions of all three bodies in space are determined, and then using the Runge-Kutta method and updating the coordinates, the trajectory of the bodies in space is determined. This simulation problem is solved using physical laws such as velocity and gravity, as well as numerical computation methods, namely the Runge-Kutta method. The AccelCalcu function here calculates the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the other two bodies on the third body in the three-body system. In the loop section of this code, first, the velocity and acceleration of each body are calculated, and then the AccelCalcu function calculates the acceleration. Finally, each body gets new coordinates based on its velocity, and the velocity is also updated based on the acceleration of each body and the time step of the loop. This process is repeated until the loop's stopping condition, reaching a specific time, is met. In the end, when observing the result, a specific orbit is seen, which is a stable simulation of several types of three-body system simulations. (The three-body system is not stable, but a stable solution is considered here.)
